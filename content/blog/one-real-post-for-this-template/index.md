## Intro to the template
This is somewhat a real blog post for the template.To use this template, simply clone this repo and open up a terminal in the folder and run npm run serve to view the site. The template have the following feature:

- Main navigation bar
- Side bar with
  - Recent post
  - Archive for the blog
- Footer with all the available page
- A somewhat responsive design (try looking it in mobile mode using the developer's tools)
- About me, main, portfolio page
- The ability to share post to social medias
- Navigate between previous and next article
- Tags system, also shows blog post with selected tags
- Thumbnail for blog post and portfolio cards

As you can see, the blog post on the main page is more prominent than those on the portfolio page. They're like that because usually, blogpost will have bigger thumbnail and more focused in graphic while the portfolio card sometimes is just the screenshot of the website/app/software/tool. In short, its to make the two pages different from each other :D. The template also has a custom 404 page. You can edit the "404" page if you want to.

Navigate around and see for yourself if the template suites your requirements.
