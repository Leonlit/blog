## Welcome back

It's been a while since I last updated my blog. I've been busy completing my University Final Year Project (FYP) and learning a lot more on TryHackMe to improve my overall skills in Cyber Security. I haven't been really productive recently as I'm "multi-tasking" between different tasks. Programming my new web application project (not public yet), writing and plannig my thesis and video presentation for my FYP, learning how to hack and do some forensics stuff on TryHackMe, learning some reverse engineering malware, and so on. 

Well, you get the point, I wasn't focusing my learning on a single path, I keep branching out onto another path when I'm already on one. I know people says that diversity is a great thing, but to learn multiple stuff a day are hard and exaushting.
