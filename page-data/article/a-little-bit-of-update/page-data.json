I've been busy completing my University Final Year Project (FYP) and learning a lot more on TryHackMe to improve my overall skills in Cyber Security. I haven't been productive recently as I'm \"multi-tasking\" between different tasks. Programming my new web application project (not public yet), writing and planning my thesis and video presentation for my FYP, learning how to hack and do some forensics stuff on TryHackMe, learning some reverse engineering malware, and so on.</p>\n<p>You get the point. I wasn't focusing my learning on a single path. I keep branching out onto another path when I'm already on one. I know people say that diversity is a great thing, but to learn multiple stuff a day is challenging and exhausting. However, I plan to create a plan to organize the time for learning various things a day. Well, also in consideration to avoid stopping something halfway, because the times up.</p>\n<h2>The New Web Application (No Name For It Yet)</h2>\n<p>The new application requires considerable skills in different layers and many sub-features that I'll need to learn and build before integrating them into the main application. One sub-feature of the main application is online messaging. I plan to do a simple version of it first to get my feet wet on managing multiple messaging groups and securing their data.</p>\n<h2>Getting that first Internship</h2>\n<p>In my last semester at my University, we were required to find an internship in related fields related to our studies. I was lucky and got an interview with a Cyber Security company. With luck and my lack of interviewing experience, I was able to get the Internship. I was told that I'll be doing some vulnerability assessments. Though the zone that I'll be able to access will be primarily limited as I am still an intern.</p>\n<p>This would be the first IT job in my life. Previously after graduating from secondary school (high school), I worked at a local retail centre. I was displeased working there as it isn't the ideal job that I would want. Short-staffed, politics, low salary, and the list go on. This was also when I started learning how to program, and boy, you won't believe that my first language was C++. I will write another article on how I started programming in another post.</p>\n<h2>New skill branch unlocked</h2>\n<p>In my lastest semester at my University, we were introduced to another exciting course, Digital Forensics. This course is exciting as it guides us like what those Detective TV series and movies do in retrieving information from deleted storage or damaged devices. Since the course is not in-depth, I decided to find some online training and lessons to learn more about the topic. I was able to get some Room done in TryHackMe and some online conference videos on the tools we could use in Digital Forensics. Some of the videos are rather old, but we could learn from their fundamental concepts.</p>\n<h2>Skills improvement</h2>\n<p>I've been focusing my learning on malware analysis and an Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDPS), Suricata. This would be mainly because my FYP is related to topics related to them. My FYP also includes setting up some Honeypots on Cloud VM and coding \"some\" python code (it's pretty long). My Linux skills improved a lot after setting up most of the components needed for my FYP.</p>\n<h2>Schedule planning</h2>\n<p>In scheduling my time, I plan to separate them like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Studying my University's courses (4 hours)</li>\n<li>Continue doing my FYP (2~3 hours)</li>\n<li>Reading books on malware analysis, reverse engineering and forensics (2 hours)</li>\n<li>Programming my new web application (2 hours)</li>\n<li>At least complete one room in TryHackMe (2 hours)</li>\n<li>Playing games (yes, I play games)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Until Next time</h2>\n<p>In the next post, I plan to write about how I got started with programming in the first place.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"A little bit of update","date":"May 17, 2022","description":"A post describing what I have been up to.","categories":["blog","news"],"thumbnail_attr":["Designed By leonlit","https://github.com/Leonlit"],"thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,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","aspectRatio":3.3333333333333335,"src":"/blog/static/f266fab91fcdbc1ea04a76929fd7d3e9/ee604/banner.png","srcSet":"/blog/static/f266fab91fcdbc1ea04a76929fd7d3e9/69585/banner.png 200w,\n/blog/static/f266fab91fcdbc1ea04a76929fd7d3e9/497c6/banner.png 400w,\n/blog/static/f266fab91fcdbc1ea04a76929fd7d3e9/ee604/banner.png 800w,\n/blog/static/f266fab91fcdbc1ea04a76929fd7d3e9/f3583/banner.png 1200w,\n/blog/static/f266fab91fcdbc1ea04a76929fd7d3e9/5707d/banner.png 1600w,\n/blog/static/f266fab91fcdbc1ea04a76929fd7d3e9/a6b88/banner.png 2958w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/a-little-bit-of-update/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/introducing-my-new-blog/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Introducing my new blog","categories":["news","blog"],"date":"Feb,2022"}},"next":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["1121241592","1174410162","125636432","3110614458","3235784119","456308405"]}
